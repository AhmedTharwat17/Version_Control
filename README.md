Pull Reguest : 
A pull request is a method of submitting contributions to an open development project.
It is often the preferred way of submitting contributions to a project using a distributed
version control system (DVCS) such as Git. A pull request occurs when a developer asks for changes committed to an external 
repository to be considered for inclusion in a projectâ€™s main repository.
